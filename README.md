# Utter

GUI frontend to the OSX say command. Heavily inspired by [say.app](http://nsgn.net/software/say).

### Why Make This App?
---

I've used say.app for years, and wondered recently if I could rebuild it (since there's no publicly available source), and then potentially add features to it. So...I made **Utter**.

### Features
---

* Simple GUI way of using the say command. Just enter text and either hit Cmd-Enter or click the play button to hear it.
* Pause and resume speech.
* Change the speed/rate, pitch, pitchmod, or volume of the speech synthesis. Can utter speech when you change the options, too.
* Save the speech to an AIFF on your desktop. Use the text itself as the filename, if you wish.

### Usage
---

Clone the repo and build the Xcode project. It was created in Xcode 5, but may work in earlier versions.

### Options
---
The options drawer can be accessed by clicking the Options button on the main window.
